## How to build
1. Edit premake5.lua so 'targetdir' and 'debugcommand' is updated to match your gf2 directory (never submit these changes though!)
2. Run 'build.cmd' to generate the Visual Studio solution and project.
3. Try and compile
4. Ensure that the GF2ASI.asi file is stored in the 'scripts' folder of your gf2 install
5. Try to run the game using the gf2 executable. Running the game via Visual Studio will cause a perpetual black screen.
